Plugins will be auto loaded into a new state. Any .py file in plugins folder will be assumed to be a valid plugin and attempted to be auto-loaded. They must follow the following form:

 - Create a class inside the py file with the same name as the file, except capitalized first letter (i.e.: posix.py -> class Posix)
 - __init__ must accept a state object and save as self.state (this is property handled at base class)
 - subclass PluginBase class
